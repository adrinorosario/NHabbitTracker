 This habbit app should also be able to track all such habbits which can be categorized into:
 - Physical habbit
 - Mental habbit
 - Digital habbit
 
 The users might want to upload photos which can be made optional along with descriptions and notes about their
 activity logs.
 
 Additionally, you should be able to categorize them month-wise and also show a summary upon the
 frequency of the activity. They should be able to update it in some way.
